FinancialPlanner
================

The main goal was practice in Java. On the other hand I wanted to start to work on one of my ideia.

The basic concept was to create an application, that is useful to handle and follow our financial situations. Recording cash flows, planning for the future and creating financial statements are the main functions.

The application is unfinished, but most of the parts are working.
Sorry for the Hungarian comments in the code.
